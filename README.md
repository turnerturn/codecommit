# codecommit
An innovation playground where brains meet brawn and code is forged in collaboration. 💥🧠 This open-source space lets CodeCommIT members test ideas, push limits, and build whatever they want—no corporate secrets allowed. If your commit feels sketchy, take a lap and ask leadership first. 🏋️‍♂️⚡

## Ground Rules
- Stay curious and innovate often.
- Anything goes as long as you follow our package structure guidelines.
- DO NOT use this space for commiting proprietary information.  If you question if a resource is even slightly questionable, it is best if you first run it by our leadership team.

## Package Structure

1. **Where should we stash our work while a project is in progress?**
   
`/projects/{team-member-alias}` folder can be used to stash your projects which are in progress.  Each team member has a sub-directory titled with an alias of their choosing ("{team-member-alias}").  Keep your stuff here until you are ready to move it to the showcase!

3. **Where can we showcase our finished work?**
   
`/showcase/{team-member-alias}` folder will be used to stash our finished projects.  Each team member has a sub-directory titled with an alias of their choosing ("{team-member-alias}").  This sub-directory is THEIR space of completed inovation items.  We encourage you to move your resources to this section of our project structure when you are ready to showcase your work.  We recommend you have a folder named for each project you finish.  This finished project's folder can include presentation files, whitepapers, documents, software solutions, or any other resources related to your project.

5. **Where do we keep our shared distributables?**
   
`/distributed` folder will be used for sharing resources amongst the team.
You can use this space to archive interesting reading material, implementation guides, project ideas, or proof of concept samples.  Only rule here is that you avoid commiting resources with file name conflicts.
aka, a file name is off limits if someone else already committed to this distributed directory with that intended spec.


## Sandboxing Environment

We encourage you to try using github codespaces when sandboxing software solutions.  It is a pretty convenient tool and you will likely enjoy the experience.
